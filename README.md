## Libraries and tools used in the project

### Android

* [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)
Provides additional convenience classes and features not available in the standard Framework API for easier development and support across more devices.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)
Write declarative layouts and minimize the glue code necessary to bind application logic and layouts.
* [Kotlin Android Extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html)
A set of Kotlin extensions for Android app development.

### Architecture and Design

* [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. 
I used  the Navigation Component,  the ViewModel,  the Room, the LiveData
Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
* [Koin]( https://insert-koin.io)
A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
Written in pure Kotlin, using functional resolution only: no proxy, no code generation, no reflection.

### Junit Testing
* [Junit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/)
JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
* [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)
Tasty mocking framework for unit tests in Java
* [JunitParams](https://github.com/Pragmatists/JUnitParams)
Parameterised tests that don't suck
* [Mockito-Kotlin](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin)
A small library that provides helper functions to work with Mockito in Kotlin.
* [MockK](https://mockk.io/)
Tasty mocking framework for unit tests in Kotlin
### View

* [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/index.html)
Allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).
* [Victor Loading](https://github.com/yankai-victor/Loading)
Just loadter

### Data Request
* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
A new way of managing background threads that can simplify code by reducing the need for callbacks. Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that convert async callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.

### Persistence

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

## P.S.
There are bad ways to use unit testing in this project. It's first project where I tried the TDD. I need more practise with a unit testing in terms of android development.
Eventualy I realized the architecture still isn't perfect and enough clean
